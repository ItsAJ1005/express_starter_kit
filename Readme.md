# 🌟 Express Starter Kit  

Welcome to the **Express Starter Kit**! 🚀 This lightweight template is designed to help you kickstart your Node.js backend development with Express.js. 🎉  

## 📋 Features  

✨ **Core Features**:  
- 🛠️ Built with [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) for fast and minimalist server development.  
- 🌍 Cross-Origin Resource Sharing enabled using [CORS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors).  
- 🗄️ Request parsing using [body-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser).  

✨ **Environment Ready**:  
- 🛡️ Environment variables handled by [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv).  

✨ **Routing**:  
- 📂 Organized routes (`/api/users`) with modular support.  
- 🏠 Root route (`/`) to confirm the server is running.  

✨ **Customization-Friendly**:  
- 🧑‍💻 Easily extendable for new APIs, middlewares, and integrations.  

## 🚀 Getting Started  

Follow these steps to set up and run the server:  

### 1️⃣ Installation  

First, clone this repository:  
```bash  
git clone https://github.com/ItsAJ1005/express_starter_kit.git 
cd <repository-name>  
```
## 2️⃣ Configuration  
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env  
PORT=5000
```

## 3️⃣ Running the Server
Start the server in development mode:

```bash
npm start
or
npm run dev
```

## 4️⃣ Test the Endpoints

#### Root Route: [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/)
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/
```

**Response:**
```arduino
Your backend is running 🍀
```

#### User Routes
Implemented in `/api/users`. You can modify this in `routes/userRoutes.js`.
